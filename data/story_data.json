    "narrative": "In the silent depths of the Net, our deep-data probes detected a whisper—a structured signal ghosting through the noise of quantum chatter. It was elegant, complex, and impossibly old. We traced its faint resonance, plotting its fluctuations over weeks. It wasn't random; it was a heartbeat in the static, an echo of a long-dead consciousness.",
